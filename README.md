## Project Overview

The **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before your opponent does. This project implements the game in Python, providing an interactive console-based interface for players.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game**: Supports two players playing alternately on the same computer.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players can only place marks in valid, unoccupied spaces.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for winning combinations after each turn.
- **Draw Scenario**: Ends the game if all spaces are filled without a winner.
